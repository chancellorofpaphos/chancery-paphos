Be it enacted as follows:

A new body politic, the County of [NAME] by name, is hereby erected and established within my Duchy of Paphos.

Said County of [Name] shall be governed, under my protection, by one Earl of [NAME] who shall use and enjoy all the powers, privileges and prerogatives which earls of my Duchy of Paphos have heretofore used and enjoyed within their respective counties.

The powers of the Earl of [NAME] shall be discharged by myself, my heirs and successors, until said title is granted by subsequent letters patent.
