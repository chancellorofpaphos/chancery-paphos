Whereas the Judicial Committee of my Duchy of Paphos has discovered several persons grossly violating, or having grossly violated, natural law, and thus of having committed transgressions morally equivalent to treachery, viz:

PERSON A for CRIME X;
PERSON B for CRIME Y;

Now be it enacted that the said PERSON A and PERSON B stand and be convicted and attainted of treachery, and that they suffer the pains and penalties as transgressors convicted and attainted of treachery.
